# GUI-Utils-Library
This Minecraft Plugin Library will help you for custom items in your guis.

# What can I do with it ?
  
  This library makes the creation of custom items faster for you.
  So you can create items and insert them when you are making your gui.
  
# Is this the final version ?
  
  Nope ! I'm currently working on upgrading it as much as I can and maximize the possbilities of this library.
  
# Why are you doing this library ? 
  
  I honestly got tired of making custom items one by one and decided to make custom functions/methods to create them.

# How to use ?
  
  When making your Minecraft plugin, simply add the jar of this in the external libraries.
  Then You can use the library in your plugin

# Is it database friendly ?

  Not already but I plan on trying to do something so it'd be possible.
  Please note that I will make it MongoDB friendly before MariaDB.
